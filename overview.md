## Anti-inflammatory / healing
### [BPC-157](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/peptides-part-2/) (body protection compound 157)
  - found in trace amounts in gastric juices
  - helpful for intestinal issues and gut healing
  - accelerates injury and wound healing via interaction with NO system, which initiates protection of endothelial tissue, increases blood flow and causes angiogenic effect
  - can be taken orally for convenience or targeted gut healing
  - injection
    - 250-350mcg 2x daily or
    - 500 -700 mcg 1x/day
  - 500mcg capsules for 30 day cycle
  
### KPV
  - anti-inflammatory peptide (inactivates inflammatory pathways in the cell nucleus) that makes up C-terminal end of melanocortin peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone(alpha-MSH)
  - airway inflammation - suppresses both lcoal and aystemic immune responses which cause airway damage and remodelling in inflammatory lung disease
  - anti-microbial effects against pathogens (eg S. aureus and C. albicans)
  - speeds wound healing
  - reduce infection
  - fight inflammation
  - better cosmetic results
  - decreased inflammation in colitis by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine synthesis and secretion
  - stops proinflammatory mechanisms in both intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells
  - supports healing of mucosal lining of the gut
  - decreases tumorigenesis
  
### [Humanin](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/peptides-part-2/) (mitochondrial peptide)
  - strong cytoprotective actions against variety of stressors and age-related diseases
    - neurological disorders
    - mitochondrial dysfunction
    - oxidative stress
    - hypoxic damage to brain
    - oxidised LDL cholesterol
  - children of centenarians have unusually high levels of humanin
  - may promote tumour growth in breast cancer (and possibly others)
  - 1mg 1-2x day for 2-8 week cycle, 1x year
  
## Sleep
### DSIP (Delta sleep-inducing peptide)
  - promotes sleep efficiency and latency / reduces tiredness
  - not beneficial for chronic insomnia
  - modulates activity of GABA (anticonvulsant action)
  - reduces emotional and psychological response to stress
  - neuroprotective effects
  - 100mcg evenings daily

## Cognitive
### Selank (TP-7)
  - synthetic peptide based on natural tuftsin (part of IgG)
  - nootropic, originally from Russia - treats anxiety, reduces depression, improves learning,memory and energy
  - binds to GABA receptors - less overall brain activity (mild sedative)
  - increase in BDNF (learning and memory)
  - modulates norepinephrine, dopamine, seratonin (motivation/focus/pleasure)
  - repair brain damage
  - increase antioxidants in livers of stressed mice
  - decrease in blood pressure
  - prevent weight gain, reduce cholesterol, reduce blood glucose
  - increase lymph to stomach / reduce size of stomach ulcers?
  - increase IL6 in depresssed patients
  - stimulate release of interferons
  - helpful for Crohn's, mold toxin, psoriasis,
  - dosage
      - injection: 75 - 200-500 mcg/daily
      - oral tablets: 500 - 2000 mg / daily
      - topical cream: 7.5mg applied to affected area
  
### Semax

## Anti-aging
### Epitalon / N-Acetyl Epitalon Amidate
  - epitalon anti-aging peptide that lengthens telomeres
  - 2.5 to 5mg daily of epitalon for maximum 50 - 100mg dose then break for 6 months
  
### GHK-Cu
### SNAP 8
### ACE-031
### ARA-290

## Fitness
### HGH Fragment 176-191
  - fragment of human growth hormone
