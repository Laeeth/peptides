_The original title of this one was Becoming a Post-human warrior. In memory of that title._

“This is the future - death's an inconvenience now, nothing more.”

_While I have a fascination for peptides, and I am always learning about them, this entire piece wouldn’t be possible without the input of someone far more knowledgeable than I am on the subject. By orders of magnitude. Credit where it is due, always._

This piece will be different from most of my others, I will try to stick less to the science and the biological and molecular pathways, and just make it broad, and simpler to understand so anyone can understand “Oh this does that, I am going to try it”. Another difference is affordability.

Given my perspective on life (over half of my life, I was super-poor, as in starving poor) I try very hard to make any possible “stack” (group of supplements) as cost-effective as biologically possible. This isn’t the case with peptides, there is a literal hidden war going on, where pharmaceutical companies and government want to regulate and outright ban the use of peptides. Why ?

Because not only **they will heal and fix you 100%, these peptides are naturally occurring, this isn’t some molecular nerd concoction in a laboratory. They are synthetic only in the sense they were made in a lab.**

Since the pandemic, the price of peptides basically tripled it used to be really affordable, and access to them harder, but peptides are not supplements, and while the entry cost is rather steep, long-term it is cost-effective.

Peptides are a small group of amino acids, after a certain size (40-50 amino acids together) it is considered a protein.

**Neurocognition/Brain**

One of the most prominent “adverse effects” of both the viral infection and the vaccination to different degrees is the neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative aspect. Most of these effects share similarities, protein expression, and are most inflammatory in nature. To recover to baseline or go above:

Cerebrolysin is a mixture of peptides and amino acids derived from porcine brain that has potent neuroprotective effects. Cerebrolysin has 30 decades of use, with extensive effects on multiple pathways in both Alzheimer’s Disease and other types of neurodegenerative pathologies (once again, they share many pathways).

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc586603a-62a1-40ef-9ee1-daf402271cff_963x639.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc586603a-62a1-40ef-9ee1-daf402271cff_963x639.png) [Source, highly recommend reading it](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21722)

I highly suspect from my understanding and knowledge of these pathways that some of these peptides, like Cerebrolysin would have their modulatory effects compounded with parts of my own stack (The Brain stack to be precise).

Cerebrolysin should potent benefit [moderate to severe ischemic strokes and significant recovery](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14737175.2018.1500459) when combined with other approaches. But most of the time you won’t do just Cerebrolysin, its best and most potent effects are achieved when taken together with [Cortexin](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254493).

> “…neuroprotective effects of highly purified animal tissue extracts used in clinical practice in rat models of brain ischemia revealed that Cortexin® or Cerebrolysin® improve the recovery of neurological functions, reduce the severity of sensorimotor and cognitive impairments.”

Cortexin by itself has a moderate effect on cognition, but it has a fairly impactful effect on [restoring the antioxidation system in the brain, and potent anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, and beyond (systemic, the entire body).](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1819712418020113)

> [The clinical efficacy of the drug Cortexin in dosages of 10 and 20 mg](https://europepmc.org/article/med/35175707) for the correction of cognitive and asthenic disorders has been proven. Revealed anti-anxiety, antidepressant and anxiolytic activity of Cortexin is more pronounced when using a dosage of 20 mg.

> The tolerability of cortexin was good. [It has been concluded that cortexin is an effective drug for treatment of children with ADHD, speech delay and consequences of a perinatal lesion of the central nervous system.](https://europepmc.org/article/med/29652302)

From the person mentioned at the very start of the piece.

> A single course of cerebrolysin at 2ml per day for 2 weeks will reverse any decline for most people and have them in a better cognitive State than they were, to begin with originally
>
> A one week course of cortexin 10 mg per day will have most people who are not vaxxed back to and probably better than their original cognitive Baseline

**Pulmonary function/Lungs/Fibrosis**

One of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection are loss of pulmonary function, lung fibrosis, and overall lower quality of cardiovascular health. And while the supplements can help heal and “fix that”, some people are rather stuck because of many reasons. These peptides will heal them. An observation, if you have fibrosis of any type, anywhere, you must take a proteolytic enzyme such as Serrapeptase and/or Nattokinase to deal with that, and then these peptides.

The first of them, and once again with multiple targets for its potent healing effects is GHK-Cu (source of the following [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2012/324832/)).

> The human tripeptide GHK was discovered in 1973 as an activity in human albumin that caused old human liver tissue to synthesize proteins like younger tissue. It has high affinity for copper ions and easily forms a copper complex or GHK-Cu. In addition, GHK possesses a plethora of other regenerative and protective actions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties. Recent studies revealed its ability to up and downregulate a large number of human genes including those that are critical for neuronal development and maintenance. We propose GHK tripeptide as a possible therapeutic agent against age-associated neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

GHK-Cu also reduces oxidative damage by modulating how iron behaving in your cells and bodiies, it can inhibit release of iron from ferritin, it can help gut healing, and lower damage by free radicals. It can increase neutrophils, but one really interesting property is gene regulation “GHK suppressed RNA production in 70% of 54 human genes overexpressed in patients with an aggressive metastatic form of colon cancer and was active at a low nontoxic 1 micromolar concentration”.

“ [These findings demonstrate that GHK-Cu](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295439/) possesses a protective effect in LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting excessive inflammatory responses; accordingly it may represent a novel therapeutic approach for ALI/ARDS.” By downregulation TNF-alpha and Interleukin-6 (potent inflammators) and reducing ROS, GHK-Cu had a protecting effect on both acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (what often happens in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection).

[It can also inhibit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320519310677) the signaling that drives the progress in idiopathic (fancy term for unknown origin) pulmonary fibrosis. Potent lung protection, and restoration of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [(COPD)](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/7/1987). It has a [potent effect on the gene expression](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm367) related to the destruction of the lung in COPD and inhibits and reverses it. Even damage dose by smoking, [it will attenuate by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress by modulating its pathways](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9354777/).

For complete lung recovery you will also need the second one. Called VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide), it is abundant in the respiratory track. A common denominator among lung diseases like COPD is the upregulation of something called VPAC1, in which [VIP will help decrease the chronic inflammation in the lungs of COPD patients](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196978109005348).

Increasing VIP expression is a protective mechanism in both pulmonary fibrosis and COPD by modulating the activation of NFAT3, the earlier you administer VIP, the faster the recovery.

The combination of both GHK-Cu + VIP will have a potent effect on anyone with Lung Fibrosis, COPD, among other issue, of course there is a massive overlap between these issues and Long Covid, so this will be beneficial for many people in the Long Covid bracket.

**You must supplement serrapeptase at high doses otherwise you will be wasting money on peptides.** These peptides will take care of the inflammation, the inflammatory signaling, certain cells you don’t want, but not the fibrosis, that is why you must use serrapeptase.

You will also need a NAD+ precursor (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide, Riboside, anything to do with NAD+) and Olive leaf extract to take care of the endothelial inflammation and repair with this combo.

Dosages are nebulize 2mg of ghk-cu and 250ug of VIP 2x a day, you can increase VIP with time, but start small.

Another peptide you can either modulate your body to produce more or outright use is LL-37, which I have written about. Other points to LL-37 are that it can help clear [bacteria by modulating phagocytosis by macrophages](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1189/jlb.0513304) (macrophages will eat the bactera), and clear it from the body.

**Immune Function**

And the last one, and arguably one of the most important from my perspective. If you have been reading my Substack for a while, or the linked pieces when I write bigger more complex ones, you will undestand the highlights in probably 5 seconds or less.

These images should speak for themselves, Thymalin has effects observed in the [real world](https://web.archive.org/web/20201104171624id_/https://www.clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijii/international-journal-of-immunology-and-immunotherapy-ijii-7-055.pdf?jid=ijii), it has a [better effect on fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer than Tocilizumab](https://europepmc.org/article/med/36169363) in severe Covid-19 patients middle aged and elderly.

I also highly recommend you read my first peptide piece, one I used **extensively** and saved my life (literally), and to be fully honest BPC-157 was the only one I used so far, it is really hard to get access to peptides here, maybe with time I will be able to experiment with the others.

There are many, many other peptides so if people have interest I can cover them in a later time, including ones for mitochondria health, and everything else.
