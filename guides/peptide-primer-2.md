Peptide Primer 2.0:

An Introduction To Healing Peptides

Note: The author is not a doctor. Readers are responsible for the safety and legality of their decisions. Consult a medical professional before making any changes. This is an introduction to peptides, not a comprehensive resource. These compounds may have side effects which aren't discussed here, and other dangers such as impurities from the manufacturing process. Many of these compounds promote growth in various ways, which may increase cancer proliferation. They may also reduce cancer risk or improve survival rates. Without long term human studies it is impossible to quantify the risks. It is your responsibility to determine if the potential benefits justify the unknown risks.

You should not pursue peptides if:

- You are healthy and looking for a shortcut to fitness.
- You think reading this google doc is sufficient "research".
- You tend to get excited about things and ignore the potential risks.
- You think injecting or consuming research chemicals isn't a big deal.
- You are unwilling to discuss these compounds with a doctor.

Intro

In the last few years I’ve been able to significantly improve my health and quality of life. There are plenty of factors, such as strength training, prioritizing rest and recovery, and many lifestyle changes. But perhaps the single greatest impact came from peptides. Not only because they do wonders on their own, but they made everything else easier. My connective tissue became less prone to injury, despite my underlying hypermobility. I can quickly resolve any new injuries rather than watch them linger and interfere with strength training. Sleep is easier, and my dysautonomia symptoms are few and far between. My own background is dealing with connective tissue problems, lingering injuries, and autonomic nervous system disfuncion (dysautonomia). [This video explains my symptoms and overall management strategy, if you’re curious.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://youtu.be/PZMrAoN0CHU%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168566696%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0d7YRkLzN5y7hVDU-simJf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168673494&usg=AOvVaw0XxtUrNXUnn6pWthbhe2il) However, this is intended to offer a general introduction to healing peptides that could be applicable to a variety of health conditions.

When I tell people about the amazing variety of peptides, and the potent effects they offer, I’m often met with quiet skepticism. I get it; sounds too good to be true. Others are intrigued, but then immediately discouraged when they hear that injections may be involved, or that their doctor is unlikely to be familiar with these compounds. Not to mention they may not be FDA approved, or even studied in humans. So rather than add to the complexity, I’d like to simplify the topic. It is your responsibility to determine what is safe and appropriate, in consultation with your doctor. But this introduction will provide the vocabulary and context to begin navigating those decisions.

Let’s start with what is a peptide? You’re no doubt familiar with amino acids. These are combined within the body to form large protein structures, generally involving hundreds of amino acids. But your body also makes smaller chains of amino acids as a way of communicating between tissues, and regulating various processes in the body. These short sequences are called peptides. You can think of peptides as an email, with the individual amino acids representing specific words. If you put the right words together and get it to the right address, you can engage specific natural processes in the body.

It’s also worth mentioning that not everything with “peptide” on the packaging has these benefits. When I say peptide, I mean sequences with impacts beyond the constituent amino acids. Any meal may contain all the words (amino acids) for BPC-157, but they don’t form a coherent message unless assembled in the appropriate sequence.

Note: Although I’ve included dosage information when able, individual needs and tolerances could vary substantially. Everyone should start with low doses to test tolerance. Anyone with immune issues or a tendency towards histamine reactions should be especially cautious. Specifically, I’ve encountered people who reacted strongly to even moderate doses of GH secretagogues. This could be due to potency variations or factors that vary between individuals. But it’s better to discover these issues at low dosages. You can always add more, but once you inject something.. you can’t pull it back out.

## BPC-157

Note: There are a few versions of BPC-157. They all have the same active amino acid sequence, but variations alter the stability. The newest form is BPC-157 Stable Version, which incorporates the amino acid arginine. The data from the arg-BPC patent shows that two hours in a ph of 2 breaks down both acetate and arginine versions substantially (2.5% vs 6% remaining). Two hours at ph of 3 breaks down acetate substantially but arginine is largely intact (7.8% vs 93.6% remaining). At ph 4, both do well (81.3% vs 99.5% remaining). If you’re using oral BPC-157 and a health condition keeps stomach ph low, arg-BPC may have an advantage. But for most people it’s not difficult to get their stomach ph to 4, in which case both versions do fine and a slightly higher dose of the acetate version may actually be more cost-effective.

Although [rodent studies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jor.21107%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168568358%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2b9AEOzNGu71DwgtymDxRd&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168673949&usg=AOvVaw1AZBT00NIc8XkXMmfEjJdg) have shown oral administration having systemic effects on peripheral injuries, I have doubts. In rodent studies the BPC-157 was administered immediately, and was augmenting the healing process. Whereas in humans it is typically used after an injury fails to heal, in which case it is expected to restart the healing process. The same studies showing oral being effective in peripheral injuries also showed matched results from shockingly small injection doses.

It may be helpful for minor injuries, I don’t know. But my background is in severe widespread connective tissue problems, and I found injected acetate version to be very helpful. I have encountered numerous people with connective tissue disorders who were confident that injected BPC-157 (acetate or arginine versions) was helpful. I haven’t encountered any who were confident that oral BPC-157 helped substantially with peripheral injuries.

names: BPC-157 Stable, BPC-157 Stable Version, BPC 157 di-L-arginine salt, Arg-BPC-157, arg-BPC. In studies it may be referred to as “[Stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://josr-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13018-019-1242-6%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168569927%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3aUy6unXuT4ieRUJbgKYPh&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168674330&usg=AOvVaw2LSs32XOnQy7ss-6VIv7Qg)”.

BPC-157 acetate (most common version) names: BPC-157 acetate, BPC-157, Body Protecting Compound 157, bepecin, Pentadecapeptide 157. [There were human trials](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/jffwm5/bpc157_human_trials_and_patent_history/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168570437%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3xdfGece2NtMhjVaK1Kt3D&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168674415&usg=AOvVaw1oY9wUJ4Njx7Omd37RYmri) using BPC-157 under the drug name PL 14736.

Origin: The sequence of amino acids was identified within a gastric peptide (BPC/Body Protection Compound) which protects the gastrointestinal tract by promoting healing and blood vessel growth. The intestines have thin walls to allow nutrient absorption, which leaves them vulnerable to physical damage and intrusion from gut bacteria.

Impact: BPC-157 significantly improves wound healing by increasing fibroblast activity. It’s impacts are especially strong in connective tissue, but it has a positive impact on many tissues and systems. Some highlights from studies ([from World-of-Peptides.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.world-of-peptides.com/a-summary-of-studies-bpc-157/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168570925%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw07upNFTh83k2Ta3ORMLG54&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168674569&usg=AOvVaw1_0GJfHGOMSpM025pPySK3)):

- BPC-157 significantly improves healing after the following injuries: skin incisions; deep skin burns; various anastomoses as intestinal wounds; diabetic wounds; various fistulas; various tissue transections, particularly ligament, tendon, muscle and nerve. Healing time of all these injuries is significantly decreased with BPC-157 administration.
- BPC-157 prevents scar tissue buildup after injury, and reduces already existing scar tissue
- BPC-157 modulates the immune system and activates macrophages in the immune system, which leads to increased production of growth factors that fight infections, ultimately strengthening the immune system.
- BPC-157 significantly prolongs survival of rats with carcinoma and melanoma B-16 cancers, from 25 days to 45+ days.
- BPC-157 prevents development of gastric ulcers and heals existing gastric ulcers by reducing the ulcer area and accelerating the rebuilding of glandular epithelium and formation of granulation tissue.
- BPC-157 successfully reduces several models of acute, non-specific inflammation.
- BPC-157 acts against temperature decrease (i.e. water immersion test) and increase (yeast- induced).
- BPC-157 increases pain threshold in carrageenan test in rats.
- BPC-157, given before infection of rats with hepatitis A virus, Lymphatic Choriomeningitis (LCM) virus and herpes virus types 1 and 2, completely prevented all signs of infection and disease.
- BPC-157 given to rats after viral infection delays onset of disease symptoms and decreases death.

1. Dosage: [Tailor Made Compounding Catalog (BPC-157: page 8/15)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16BQyrotyDR180qhd3AI-lE7Gnt6X_gek/view?usp%253Dsharing%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168577682%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2ebGElNv_mbZhyl5AJb4sC&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168676241&usg=AOvVaw3jkStAQLGEPF2zvz04Agrg) suggests 300mcg 1x/day for 30 days. Many people (myself included) have used 250mcg injections 2x/day with good results. The minimum effective dose in rodent studies may be as low as 1mcg/kg bodyweight, but up to 10mcg/kg is also used. A person could start with 100mcg 1x/day and slowly increase dosage and frequency. When using BPC-157 Stable for subcutaneous injection, I use 100mcg instead of 250mcg. I’m not dealing with significant acute issues anymore, so it’s hard to say if the effect is matched.


1. Oral (good option for GI issues, some systemic effect):  The Stable Version is especially appropriate orally, [I don't have a demo of oral preparation, but this video discusses dosing.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://youtu.be/1FVx0SePygE?t%253D5m14s%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168578109%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0_3d_9rZ2zRf2KPx4aqIw8&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168676345&usg=AOvVaw3heSI1-ow9WMhAOxpKJYKM)

1. Dosage: 500mcg capsules 2x/day seems to be common. If using a powder such as BeePC, a person could mix 5mg BPC-157 Stable Version with 10ml bacteriostatic water in a dropper bottle. That would deliver 500mcg per 1ml (about 20 drops). Or 5mg could be mixed with 5ml, in which case 1/2ml (about 10 drops) would deliver 500mcg. It could also be weighed into capsules. [biopuresupplements.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.biopuresupplements.com/index.php?route%253Dproduct/product%2526product_id%253D50%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168578411%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3dyTKnUQxK2F90FIsLzwcE&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168676426&usg=AOvVaw1EDwkFr3HzvGOCOa9jLMzF) advises 250mcg of their Stable BPC liquid sublingually 2x/day, but a person could just swallow it.


Final note on BPC-157: Although I like BPC-157 Stable Version, I had great results from subcutaneous injection of the standard (acetate) version more commonly sold.

## Ipamorelin

Names: Ipamorelin, developmental code name NNC 26-0161. Ipamorelin is a Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide, and there are other GHRPs.

Origin: Ipamorelin is a short peptide sequence capable of binding to the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor, replicating the growth hormone releasing effect of ghrelin without unpleasant side effects. It is one of the most selective growth hormone secretagogues known and has been shown in laboratory studies to have no effect on ACTH, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or cortisol release.

Impact: By injecting Ipamorelin subcutaneously, it induces the pituitary to release stored growth hormone into the bloodstream. This growth hormone has a variety of effects, which may include decreased body fat, increased collagen production, increased lean muscle mass, improved sleep, increased cellular repair and regeneration, increased bone density, and reduced catabolism. Besides increasing overall GH, Ipamorelin also releases it in a pulse. As we age, we lose the pulsatile release and our GH trickles out in an ineffective manner. By restoring the pulse of GH it can reach the tissues throughout the body more effectively.

[Ipamorelin is a GHRP, it should be paired with a GHRH](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/2j2wj1/beginners_guide_to_ghrpghrh_peptides/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168581144%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0v09jZtiKVDET8NlrAzDml&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677032&usg=AOvVaw2NkfG-AP05K1eoTixzQ0NG). Some people use 200-300mcg up to 3x/day, spaced 4+hrs apart.  Note: Some people advocate a lower dose, such as 100mcg Ipamorelin and Mod-GRF. The idea is that going beyond that only increases GH by a small percentage and isn’t as cost effective. [I don’t have a study to point to, but this is addressed in the DatBtrue archive.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/wiki/index%2523wiki_a_brief_summary_of_dosing_and_administration%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168581593%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2NDx4ZthE4BhNyg85YRzrz&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677101&usg=AOvVaw0U7Cebt9wWe5gsZ-g1DR4p)I’d suggest starting with a very low dose, there are anecdotal reports of allergic reactions. There could have been other factors, but I’ve had adverse reactions to high doses.

Timing: The standard advice is to wait 2-3hrs after eating, and don’t eat for 1/2hr after injection. The reason being that Insulin interferes with GH, so injecting in a fasted state is suggested for maximum effect. However, when a GHRH and GHRP are used together it may not matter, as suggested by [this bovine study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11431156/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168582042%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1-9pEVRmbEEVQQThojsw5f&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677205&usg=AOvVaw2CMvbt9MgVKzm4BOJ13Yg6). GH release is also blocked by the presence of somatostatin. Again, a GHRH/GHRP combo may overcome this, or it may be worth timing your injections when somatostatin is low, and the body is primed to release GH. [This page has a graph](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://nutridylan.com/2012/04/24/growth-hormone-and-nighttime-carbs-much-ado-about-nothing-12/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168582264%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0N91ttcSOqhFrn74BXg0cP&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677266&usg=AOvVaw2U1xF9yyEfPvPMx0bukGEd) of natural GH release. This reasoning would suggest the evening is a good time, shortly before bed. There may also be a good opportunity immediately after waking. The night time release is [more likely timed off of darkness](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://images.app.goo.gl/KgbsSGA4ruVnHjE96%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168582505%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2FN1HpC-UTgTytrewjEQFh&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677326&usg=AOvVaw1hP68UxmOCdCZd_UKrdccL), rather than the clock. I put on blue blocking glasses 2hrs before bed to encourage melatonin production, but it may also reduce my somatostatin and increase the effectiveness of the GH secretagogues. Again, this may all be unnecessary with GHRH/GHRP combos, I don’t know for sure.

## Mod-GRF (1-29) aka CJC-1295 without DAC

Names: CJC-1295 w/o DAC, CJC-1295 No DAC, Modified GRF (1-29)

Origin: Mod-GRF (1-29) is a slightly modified version of a peptide sequence in [Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone%2525E2%252580%252593releasing_hormone%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168583218%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3zF8-L-Cy5bDeqHG3HLU1e&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677487&usg=AOvVaw3kWtRMxa0WIcGdZUkvumth) (GHRH).

Impact: Mod-GRF increases the number of cells that respond to a GHRP such as Ipamorelin, potentially delivering 5x the pulse compared to Ipamorelin alone. Even if you don’t want a huge pulse of GH, using low doses of both together is much more cost effective than either compound separately.

[Some guides suggest 100mcg is adequate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/wiki/index%2523wiki_a_brief_summary_of_dosing_and_administration%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168585219%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1AEDj-4VtBH2mfXWBAIM0A&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168677928&usg=AOvVaw23HhqnnPPulXty9f-Q-Dck), and I personally agree. Again, insulin may diminish the impact of GH, so injecting in a fasted state may produce the strongest effect. The standard advice is to wait 2-3hrs after eating, and don’t eat for 1/2hr after injection. Read the Timing info for Ipamorelin.

What the heck is DAC?: Drug Affinity Complex, or DAC, is a chemical complex attached to the peptide sequence which prevents breakdown by the enzyme peptidase and excretion by the liver. This results in a drastically increased half-life. In many peptides, this would be helpful. But when we are intentionally inducing a brief pulse of GH, the DAC isn’t appropriate.

A note about growth hormone side effects: A search for “growth hormone side effects” may yield alarming results. It’s worth noting that these are generally associated with the injection of HGH at supraphysiological levels, not the use of secretagogues. By using secretagogues we stay within a range our bodies might experience naturally, thereby reducing the risk of side effects.This doesn’t mean there couldn’t be side effects, consult your doctor.

## TB-500 aka Thymosin Beta-4

Names: TB-500, Thymosin Beta-4, TB4

Note: Although some [sources assert that TB-500 is identical](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://tb-500.com/blogs/articles/difference-between-tb-500-and-thymosin-beta-4%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168586295%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0GqMd68BCGMILh5lmKYrY7&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168678244&usg=AOvVaw3uMESuUmm-PFoMb0xZo9fQ) to TB4 (except being a synthesized version), strictly speaking TB-500 is Frag 17-23 of TB4. However, many products sold as TB-500 are probably full sequence TB4. I have a [Reddit post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/klc1u1/tb4tb500_human_trials_dosages_etc/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168586582%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0XPPK6OfOTCb2Nx1vi5322&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168678313&usg=AOvVaw1PoBtSyrQuuPSHzX3NEv_K) on the topic.

“A number of active sites on Tβ4 have been identified for some of these activities. Amino acid fragments 1-4 is anti-inflammatory, 1-15 is anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective, and 17-23 is active for cell migration, actin binding, dermal wound healing, angiogenesis, and hair growth.” ([Source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid%253D2423767%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168586974%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3rhooZo5n8brlmcupCX43Z&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168678452&usg=AOvVaw09HRWGU_L6lVkdcC8jl5zR))

In this doc TB-500 will specifically refer to Frag 17-23, while TB4 means the full 43 amino acid sequence

Origin: TB4 is a naturally occurring 43-amino acid peptide present in many human and animal cells. Red blood cells contain TB4, and it is released when they burst open to seal a wound.

Impact: A 2015 meta-analysis showed broad applicability of TB4 in various disease processes, including improvement of tissue regeneration, repair of the heart after heart attack, healing of the brain following stroke, trauma and neurological diseases, kidney and liver diseases, and repair of spinal cord, bone and ligament injuries, as well as reducing consequences of aging and viral infection. The primary mechanisms of action seem to be increasing actin production, increasing angiogenesis, and reducing inflammation. It is often paired with BPC-157. TB500 (Frag 17-23) is responsible for the actin binding activity.

Note: this may increase flexibility during use, although I just experienced reduced spasticity. This may be desirable for tight muscles, but could also exacerbate instability in joints.

This has a limited track record in humans, so it’s unclear what approach is best.

## ARA-290

Names: ARA-290, ARA 290, Cibinetide, PH-BSP

Origin: ARA-290 is a sequence derived from erythropoietin (EPO). EPO stimulates red blood cell production, but has also been found to stimulate blood vessel growth, promote cell survival, alter blood pressure, and produce neuroprotective effects in diabetic neuropathy. ARA-290 offers the neuroprotective and pain relieving effects of EPO without stimulating red blood cell production.

Impact: ARA-290 may reduce neuropathic pain and stimulate small fiber nerve repair. It is a potential stimulator of wound repair in chronic diabetes, an immune modulator, and a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. It caught my eye because it [may be beneficial for some types of dysautonomia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://www.araimpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/oct282014.pdf%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168591406%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1MFlP4hmq1Ot9zQNzS_XT5&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168679489&usg=AOvVaw0S54hZoUkkJhKKnhbeFB93) (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system). I don’t have significant dysautonomia symptoms anymore, but it’s still an area of interest and the standard treatments are primarily management related.

Delivery & dosage: There are no established dosages. One study stated “The power analysis was based on data collected from a double-blind trial of the safety and efficacy of ARA 290 in patients with sarcoidosis and symptoms of small fiber neuropathy that received

4 mg ARA 290 SC daily for 28 d.”

Another trial included 1mg, 4mg, and 8mg groups. Personally, if I were to pursue this peptide I would start at much lower doses. I’d also attempt to quantify a healthy amount of EPO in the body, and infer the amount of ARA-290 based on its size in comparison to EPO. This would offer some context to how much exogenous ARA-290 I’d be comfortable with.

Note: Epobis is another peptide sequence derived from EPO with [similar effects](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22469063/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168593750%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0RBW_9u2L6-YWheT9MO94h&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680120&usg=AOvVaw0N-ySKR68ep-78o5mRyokA).

# Routes to Peptides

So maybe you’re intrigued. Here are some options, depending on your comfort level.

1. The prescription route. This is generally more expensive, but offers confidence that you are using quality medications under the supervision of a doctor.

1. Ask your current doctor to [set up an account with a compounding pharmacy like Tailor Made Compounding](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://emr.tailormadehealth.com/register.aspx%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168594333%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2e5fel_DY9GnAKo8lusTw9&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680300&usg=AOvVaw1UX3D6mNTVZIxIq7ZikXa6) that mails products to patients. There may be local compounding pharmacies in your area, or other ways for your doctor to fill the prescription. You may need to direct your doctor towards resources for learning about these medications, as they are unlikely to be familiar with them.
2. Find a new doctor who prescribes peptides. [The International Peptide Society](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://peptidesociety.org/prp-patients/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168594639%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1YJWWk3gnJ23PL70F2_waZ&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680386&usg=AOvVaw0k3hvLoDUvnB_kT6BzCK_f) may be able to help you find a physician in your area. There are also [clinics which offer online consultations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/9um03e/a_list_of_doctors_who_are_prescribing_peptides/?utm_source%253Dshare%2526utm_medium%253Dios_app%2526utm_name%253Diossmf%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168594890%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw32IEkfNGXEOM0ywzqICGYN&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680446&usg=AOvVaw1a-xQSIgQSkRsGV6AqwQZc). You could also look for local anti-aging clinics which often prescribe GH secretagogues.


1. The legally-grey nonprescription route. For those willing to take matters into their own hands, this route is faster and more flexible. Often the products are intended for laboratory use, and will be labeled “not for human consumption”. Although possession of these compounds isn’t illegal (from my understanding), injecting or consuming them may be a violation of the purchase agreement. Here is [a list of peptide sources I have heard good things about](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDwbSXiEOlCAvFTiaruf5JQOpEFNh2bK-Q8yRQL2yGk/edit?usp%253Dsharing%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168595289%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1DaLWENn3HL04xvbO0oJfK&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680574&usg=AOvVaw3e8s08DVG3jzz-AWxz6Ifq). I want to be clear: good businesses go bad quickly. It is your responsibility to vett sources to your personal satisfaction.
2. The nonprescription (but labeled for human use) route. Although limited, there are some peptide options which don’t require prescriptions and are labeled for human use. Unfortunately, this is an area where unscrupulous people could relieve you of your money. None of these are endorsements!

1. [Tailor Made Health has BPC-157](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://shop.tailormadehealth.com/products/bpc-157%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168595867%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw15hB_IzPF81bwH02JW9QXF&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680682&usg=AOvVaw1uncXl2Dgd3D9_qz69Njur) capsules available as dietary supplements. They have submitted a GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) filing with the FDA. [BioPureSupplements](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.biopuresupplements.com/index.php?route%253Dproduct/product%2526product_id%253D53%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168596089%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3qU_bJ98YQp-lQV7P0sQat&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680739&usg=AOvVaw1rqdmxR9pDuagWulUZ9xVa) has stated their Liquid Stable BPC is FDA compliant as labeled.
2. There are[transdermal patches claiming to deliver BPC-157](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.ageforce.com/supplements/bpc157%2523%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168596426%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw30kTXTbZOqua_NbOVL87pT&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680841&usg=AOvVaw3iGsdsEtKYkPJ06jOiF9xw), I’m very sceptical. The BPC-157 compound is around 1400 Daltons, while the size limit for transdermal delivery seems to be 400-500 Daltons. This may provide local benefits to the skin. I wouldn’t expect systemic effects. To their credit, the patches contain 1mg BPC-157 each. There are also pseudo-BPC supplements which make grand claims but are vague about the ingredients, which I’m very sceptical of. I’ve previously been very skeptical of Dr Seeds BPC, and I have never seen a compelling positive review outside the Dr Seeds website. I’m now more agnostic on the topic. [Here is some info regarding TMH, TMC, and Dr Seeds.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/isswvm/tailor_made_health_is_the_sister_company_to/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168596807%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1UsrUSde1em-_wQgeVbYxx&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168680920&usg=AOvVaw2Kvt_-31DueTtzeHgGymLz)
3. A topical option. There are also creams and lotions which include bioactive peptides with beneficial impacts on skin and collagen. The effects are generally mild and superficial.

4. Russian bioregulators. The modern approach to peptides is to identify a specific sequence and synthesize it in a lab. But the original approach was to harvest and extract a variety of peptides from the organs of young animals. [This method produced a complex of peptides which could then be used to revitalize the same organs and tissues in humans.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://antiaging-nutrition.com/250-peptide-bioregulators%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168598802%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0LBYOeVt4sdrYiZ0HiSYjh&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681491&usg=AOvVaw2RY6nAoibJgMS99X_Om__j) Although the general concept may be sound, I have doubts about the oral effectiveness and how delicate peptides survive the refining process. You could try breaking the capsules open under your tongue, where the smaller peptides have a chance to reach the bloodstream. Overall, I can’t recommend this or completely dismiss it for those who have the money and interest. [Sources are surprisingly easy to find.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://smile.amazon.com/5-Cerluten-Natural-Bioregulator-capsules/dp/B01N2KF9TH/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168599039%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1Jzii5dFSDv11beJKdVc7J&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681569&usg=AOvVaw2Vzj3uzPUmWM6EGxiQOZ8H) If you’re interested in these products [check out this bizarre documentary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%253Dc_GLtI01ykU%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168599294%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0Ylp8y5MhbgKP--ns2a6SY&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681639&usg=AOvVaw1vQ_t_dHlQECSGAVCC9IWg). They start getting to the point around 9:15, but I suggest watching the whole thing for the full experience.

# Supplies

If you’re taking the plunge into subcutaneous injection, you’ll need some supplies.

1. Insulin syringes with needles.29-30G is a common needle width (higher number = narrower needle). 1cc/1ml is a good volume, ½ inch is probably the best needle length. A shorter needle may actually cause more irritation, but this is an area of debate. There are many sources, including local pharmacies. [Here is an example.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://smile.amazon.com/BD-Ultra-Fine-Insulin-Syringes-Gauge/dp/B07F5ZS6KS%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168599991%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw17xPGLMKCloCihh0u3m4OV&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681789&usg=AOvVaw1yizSwGZieo8j_3V-_NaIh) Make sure the syringes include needles, it’s not always obvious from the packaging. These are one time use, so plan on one syringe per injection. It’s fine to inject multiple peptides at once.
2. Alcohol wipes. It’s important to sanitize the vials and skin before each injection. [Here is an example.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://smile.amazon.com/Curad-Alcohol-Prep-Thick-Swabs/dp/B00KOSP454/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168600424%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw26HFBvrWqd3kDfZxr0rFJT&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681900&usg=AOvVaw1Wb-Fo5y0pOmjdQa6THBoh)
3. Bacteriostatic water. This water is sterile and contains enough alcohol to inhibit bacterial growth. Other types (such as sterile or distilled) don’t provide the same protection. [You may need to shop around due to shortages.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://medlabgear.com/products/hospira-bacteriostatic-water-for-injection-30ml-usp?_pos%253D1%2526_sid%253D12938edbc%2526_ss%253Dr%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168600818%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0e_i8V5RCO1bUI0JqpKm34&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168681986&usg=AOvVaw1EQnXYFVU6Y9QMpI4ezNZW)

A note about injections: This can be a daunting process at first. It can sting, and local irritation is common. If your hands are shaky, it could bruise. Occasionally it will bleed. These issues will be less common as you become more familiar with the process and develop good technique. Just keep in mind that you wouldn’t be surprised if a vaccination stung or bled a little bit, despite being administered by a professional. Personally, once I decided that peptides were worth trying I didn’t worry about the injection process until the needles were in front of me. Someone actually asked me if I had ever injected myself before and I immediately said yes. But then after thinking about it I said “oh wait, those were goats”.

My point is, don’t overthink it. Also, injecting yourself is a hell of a lot easier than injecting goats.

# Storage

In general, lyophilized (dry powder) peptides should be kept in a freezer and reconstituted peptides should be kept in the refrigerator and away from heat and UV light. Some guides suggest peptides are extremely vulnerable to mechanical damage, to the point where they shouldn’t be kept in the door of the fridge because of jostling. Although there’s nothing wrong with being gentle, it’s probably not a major concern. Reconstituted peptides won’t last forever in the fridge, but [there is evidence](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid%253D2782723172049489%2526id%253D1979528065702341%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168601772%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3ZrC4qDZLd0pVeVovihNjD&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168682247&usg=AOvVaw3eP1ayQ1pdd_b0A0YvcewA) they are quite stable (some peptides will break down faster than others). [Peptide Sciences has some very concervative recommendations for storage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.peptidesciences.com/information/peptide-storage/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168602043%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3BEr-vFyP6snj-eW3KctzT&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168682319&usg=AOvVaw1rE_wX4z7U1zCfXemJrn1X), explains the possibility of bacterial growth, and discourages multiple freeze-thaw cycles.

In summary:

- Keep powdered peptides in the freezer.
- Reconstitute vials as you need them (not all at once).
- Always use bacteriostatic water to inhibit bacterial growth.
- Keep reconstituted peptides in the fridge, preferably in a box that keeps airborne bacteria off the seals.
- Consistently swab seals with alcohol before use to avoid bacterial growth.
- Don’t freak out if you drop your vial or leave it out and it warms up.
- Don’t freeze reconstituted peptides.

# How to Dose Peptides

So now you have a vial of peptides, a box of syringes, and some bacteriostatic water. The next step is to reconstitute it and draw the correct amount into a syringe for injection.

Note: There’s a reason I don’t link to ‘peptide calculators’. If you understand the math you won’t need them, and if you don’t understand the math you can’t trust the results. Dosage calculation is a non-negotiable skill you must become comfortable with to pursue peptides safely. I’ve split this into three methods of increasing complexity. Method 1 has the simplest math, but read Method 2 for an explanation of the reconstitution steps.

Essential skills: You must be able to convert milligrams to micrograms, and units to milliliters. A ‘unit’ isn’t a universal measurement, but within this document we are referring to the U-100 standard in which there are 100 units in a ml. If your 1ml syringe has marks indicating a range from 0-100, you can proceed as written. If you have smaller syringes or different markings, you’ll need to make adjustments.

Conversions:

100 units = 1ml

1 unit = .01ml

1mg = 1,000mcg

1mcg = .001mg

Method 1: Reconstituting with the amount of bacteriostatic water required to deliver the desired dose in 10 units.

The goal of reconstitution is to dissolve a certain weight of peptide in a volume of bacteriostatic water. Then to pull an amount of the water into a syringe that will deliver the desired weight of peptide.

The most common approach is to use a specific amount of bacteriostatic water to reconstitute, such as 2 or 3ml. Then pull the appropriate number of units into the syringe. This is convenient for adjusting doses over time, and is explained in Methods 2 & 3.

However, the simplest possible approach is to choose a dosage and the number of units you want to inject, and then reconstitute the peptide with the exact amount of water required for that concentration. This will make it easy to deliver your desired dosage, but adjusting the dose later on may require some math.

To do this you simply divide the total weight of the peptide in the vial by the desired dosage to get the number of doses in the vial. The only requirement is that they be in the same units of measurement.

Then you simply multiply the number of doses by the desired number of units. I recommend 10 units. The result is the number of units to use for reconstitution.

What you need to know:

How many milligrams (mg) in vial?

Converted to mcg:

How many micrograms (mcg) in desired dose?

Multiply mg by 1,000 to get mcg OR divide mcg by 1,000 to get mg. Either way, you must match units of measurement.

Example: 5mg vial, 250mcg dose

5mg/.250mg = 20 doses

OR

5,000mcg/250mcg = 20 doses

20 doses X 10 units = 200 units (2ml)

So you inject 2ml (two full 1ml syringes) into the vial to reconstitute. And pull 10 units out of the vial to deliver the 250mcg dose.

Example: 2mg vial, 250mcg dose

2mg/.250mg = 8 doses

OR

2,000mcg/250mcg = 8 doses

8 doses X 10 units = 80 units (.8ml)

So you inject .8ml (80% of a 1ml syringe) into the vial to reconstitute. And pull 10 units out of the vial to deliver the 250mcg dose.

Example: 2mg vial, 100mcg dose

2mg/.100mg = 20 doses

OR

2,000mcg/100mcg = 20 doses

20 doses X 10 units = 200 units (2ml)

So you inject 2ml (two full 1ml syringes) into the vial to reconstitute. And pull 10 units out of the vial to deliver the 100mcg dose.

Method 2: Using 2ml to dissolve 5mg, and a chart to determine units for injection.

This example uses 2ml to dissolve 5mg. This is generally enough bacteriostatic water to dissolve the peptide, and results in 25mcg per unit. This makes the math easy, as 10 units = 250mcg.

1. Use an alcohol wipe to sanitize the seals. Also sanitize the skin around the injection site.
2. Draw 1ml of bacteriostatic water into the syringe.
3. Inject the 1ml into the vial of peptides. It may be best to aim for the wall of the vial and be gentle, it may not matter at all. Before withdrawing the needle, pull 1ml of air into the syringe. This will equalize the pressure.
4. Inject the 1ml air into the bacteriostatic water vial, equalizing pressure.
5. Repeat steps 2-4. You should now have 2ml of bacteriostatic water in the peptide vial.
6. Gently roll the vial, or wait for the peptides to dissolve.
7. Use the chart below and draw your desired dosage into the syringe.

Method 3. Using 3ml to dissolve 5mg, and a chart to determine units for injection.

I often use 3ml to dissolve 5mg. It’s always enough to dissolve the peptide, and I prefer working with a little more liquid in each dose. I’ve included more math to give you the tools to navigate other situations.

I’m going to explain what to do if your peptide vial is 5mg (a measurement of weight equivalent to 5,000mcg), your syringes are 1ml (volume equivalent to 1cc), and your desired dosage is 250mcg (equal to .25mg). Steps 6, 7, & 8 are optional, but intended to give you the tools to navigate other scenarios. Math results are rounded for clarity.

1. Wipe all the seals with an alcohol pad, and the area of skin where you’ll be injecting.
2. Draw 1ml of bacteriostatic water into the syringe by pulling it back to the 100 units marking.
3. Gently spray the 1ml into the vial of peptides, preferably aimed at the wall of the vial.
4. Before removing the syringe, draw 1ml of air into the syringe. This will restore neutral pressure.
5. Inject the 1ml of air into the bacteriostatic water container (neutralizing pressure), and repeat steps 2-5 until there are 3ml in the peptide vial.
6. Get out a calculator. We now have 5mg dissolved in 3ml. So divide 5 by 3 to get 1.6667. That’s how many mg are in each 1ml. We want to know what percentage of a ml is necessary to deliver 250mcg (.250mg). So divide .25 by 1.6667 and you’ll get .15, or 15%. Our 1ml syringe has 100 units, so 15% is 15 units, or .15ml
7. To double check your math, again divide 5mg by 3ml to get 1.6667, but this time multiply it by .15. The result should be .25, representing the .25mg (250mcg) of peptide in 15 units.
8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 until it clicks. Test yourself with these scenarios if you want to be sure you understand. Answers at the end of the doc (rounded for clarity).

1. If you dissolve 5mg in 3ml, and want a dosage of 200mcg.. How many units will you draw into the syringe for injection?
2. If you dissolve 5mg in 3ml, and draw 20 units into the syringe.. How many mcg will that deliver?
3. If you dissolve 2mg in 2ml, and want a dosage of 250mcg.. How many units will you draw into the syringe for injection?
4. Oops, you ordered .5ml syringes, the markings go up to 50 units. How many times will you fill the syringe to transfer 2ml?
5. The syringes you ordered are 1ml/1cc, but the markings go from .1 up to 1.0.. You originally wanted 25 units, what will the equivalent be on this syringe?

1. Once the peptide is fully dissolved, and you’re confident in your math, draw 15 units into the syringe. This will contain 250mcg of the peptide if the vial had 5mg, and was reconstituted with 3ml.
2. Use an alcohol wipe on the injection site if you haven’t already.

# Down the Rabbit Hole

For every tissue, organ, and bodily system there are peptides we know of, and many more which remain unidentified. In this section I will introduce you to a handful of peptides that may be relevant to general health. Most summaries come from [Peptide Sciences](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://peptidesciences.com/information/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168619425%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0M6zhv-bCxJwlprFIFTCWc&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168685460&usg=AOvVaw1o8dLXTb8rlTtztJotba1Z).

- MK-677. MK677 is another optionfor increasing Growth Hormone levels, without injection. This isn’t a peptide. Let’s call it a “research liquid”. You drink a small amount and it causes several growth hormone pulses over the next 12-24hrs. It’s in the same legal grey area as peptides, so finding a reputable source or a prescription can be a challenge. [Here is a study that showed some of the benefits.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/83/2/320/2865101%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168620430%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0USO7ZcxusQ-sq2ek4MCvu&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168685695&usg=AOvVaw260Olq39JZaJgPJK1-eSA4) Keep in mind that muscle growth was mostly seen in the elderly (who have low GH). MK677 is a ghrelin mimetic, and ghrelin is the hormone that makes you feel hungry and causes the sensation many people associate with low blood sugar. In reality, your blood sugar is usually fine, it’s just ghrelin making you feel awful. But blood glucose testing is a good way to confirm.

- Thymosin Alpha 1 (chronic infection, autoimmune disorders): Thymosin alpha-1 is a naturally occurring peptide fragment that was discovered in 1972. It has since been studied in clinical trials for cystic fibrosis, infection (e.g. tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus), respiratory disorders, chronic hepatitis, and cancer. It is currently approved for use in fighting chronic hepatitis B and C infections in 35 under-developed nations.

- GHK-Cu (connective tissue, anti-aging, immune, etc): GHK-Cu is a naturally occurring peptide first isolated from human blood plasma. It has since been identified in urine and saliva as well. Research into GHK-Cu has found the short peptide to have substantial benefits in wound healing and immune function. It has anti-aging properties and has been found to suppress free-radical damage, increase protein synthesis, fight bacteria, and increase the health of skin and skin fibroblasts.

- DSIP (sleep, etc): Delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) is a short peptide of natural origin. It gains its name from its ability to cause sleep in rabbits and from the fact that it was first isolated in 1977 from the brains of rats during slow-wave sleep. The peptide, however, has a number of physiologic and endocrine roles that are slowly being uncovered as it gains interest among researchers. Right now, it is known that DSIP can alter corticotropin levels, inhibit somatostatin secretion, limit stress, normalize blood pressure, alter sleep patterns, and alter pain perception. It may also have future applications in cancer treatment, depression, and the prevention of free radical damage.

- LL-37 (immune system, chronic infection): LL-37 is the only known human cathelicidin, which is a large protein family with diverse function. These peptides, which are primarily found in macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (both types of white blood cell), are important for killing bacteria, but have been found to have other dramatic effects as well. The entire class is often referred to as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). LL-37 has been found to play important roles in autoimmune disease, cancer, and wound healing. [LL-37 and gut health](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://youtu.be/NiffPSWfibA%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168622631%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw08yRLkX6PsD3gispXb4Z3x&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168686346&usg=AOvVaw3RRgKDLGrDgnUU6BRwii66)

- Peg-MGF (repair & hypertrophy of muscles, etc): Pegylated Mechano-growth factor (PEG-MGF) is a truncated and slightly altered form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Research shows that it stimulates myoblast (muscle cell) proliferation and differentiation. It has also been explored in research focused on increasing endurance, boosting the function of the immune system, lowering cholesterol, and reducing total body fat. There is also some evidence to suggest that PEG-MGF improves immune function related to healing and could therefore less the time it takes for wounds to heal.

- Epithalon/Epitalon (anti-aging, telomeres, immune, sleep, etc): The short-peptide epithalon has been shown to promote proliferation of lymphocytes from the thymus during aging. This is important, as declining expression of lymphocyte interferon gamma is tightly implicated with decreasing immune function in the elderly. It is specifically postulated that epithalon can increase lymphocyte interferon gamma production, thus improving immune function in the elderly.

        An interesting theory of aging has been put forth by Khavinson VKh, that involves epithalon. The idea is that aging is an evolution-determined biological process of changes in expression of genes, which result in impaired synthesis of regulatory chemicals, provoking change and development of disease. Given the Hayflick limit (the number of times a cell line can divide prior to its limitations and demise), and the known telomere-lengthening effects of epithalon, it is thought that the administration of the peptide may overcome these genetic limitations, and promote normalized body functions, that is, extend healthy life.

- Pinealon (misc): Pinealon is a short peptide consisting of just three amino acids. It is one of a handful of synthetic peptides referred to as peptide bioregulators for their ability to interact directly with DNA to alter gene expression levels. Pinealon has been linked to behavior modification and is thought to help protect a number of cell types, including neurons, against the effects of hypoxia. By direct effect on the pineal gland, pinealon may reduce problems with drug metabolism, circadian rhythm disorders, memory, learning, and more.

- Thymalin (inflammation, pain, immune, etc): Thymalin is the synthetic version of thymulin, which was isolated from the thymus in 1977. Thymalin has been shown to play a role in regulating inflammation and pain, has neuroprotective effects, and is important in immune function. Early research revealed that thymalin and other extracts of the thymus and pineal gland can prolong life.

- Fragment 176-191: Fragment 176-191 is a small piece of human growth hormone (hGH) that is sometimes referred to as the lipolytic fragment. Fragment 176-191 earned this latter name due to the fact that laboratory research has shown it to enhance fat burning, particularly in mice genetically engineered to produce large fat stores. Fragment 176-191 has been heavily researched in animal models because even while it preserves the fat-burning effects of hGH, it avoids some other effects of its parent protein such as increasing insulin-like growth factor-1 levels, negatively impacting carbohydrate metabolism, altering insulin sensitivity, increasing long bone growth, and so forth. The targeted effects of fragment 176-191 make it useful for exploring human fat metabolism and may eventually provide the basis for developing anti-obesity medications. Note: this compound could be of interest to those struggling to lose fat, especially those avoiding intense exercise due to illness or injury. It can liberate energy from fat stores, which can then be burned through low intensity exercise instead. Unfortunately the body quickly becomes desensitized, and it’s not a great option for those seeking significant fat loss. [Greg Doucette yelling about Frag 176-191](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v%253D8Hp1ExYShKI%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1666625168623852%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2bHJJpJsjOoOlkXcZzo8hn&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666625168686728&usg=AOvVaw1dGrscH26dEGe5VzhMZtxS). Some people believe the common forms of Frag aren’t structured correctly to elicit the desired results, and it may be useless.

# Peptide Math Answers

(Rounded for clarity)

1. If you dissolve 5mg in 3ml, and want a dosage of 200mcg.. How many units will you draw into the syringe for injection?

1. 5mg/3ml = 1.6667mg/ml
2. .2mg/1.6667mg = .12 = 12% = 12 units

1. If you dissolve 5mg in 3ml, and draw 20 units into the syringe.. How many mcg will that deliver?

1. 5mg/3ml = 1.6667mg/ml
2. .2 X 1.6667mg = .3333mg = 333.3mcg


1. If you dissolve 2mg in 2ml, and want a dosage of 250mcg.. How many units will you draw into the syringe for injection?

1. 2mg/2ml = 1mg/ml
2. .25mg/1mg = .25 = 25% = 25 units


1. Oops, you ordered .5ml syringes, the markings go up to 50 units. How many times will you fill the syringe to transfer 2ml?

1. 2ml/.5ml = 4


1. The syringes you ordered are 1ml/1cc, but the markings are: .1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8, .9, 1.0.. You originally wanted 25 units, what will the equivalent be on this syringe?

1. 25 units is equal to .25ml, or halfway between .2 and .3
